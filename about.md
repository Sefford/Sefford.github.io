**I'm Sa√∫l, nice to meet you!**
====

I am a Developer from Spain. Currently working for [Chicisimo](https://chicisimo.com) as an Android Developer.

As an active member of the Android community in Spain, I frequently share my knowledge with the rest of it, normally by speaking in conferences.

**Apps should work like magic** is my personal philosophy on how to tackle my job, and I strive for excellence to the best of my knowledge. Building great apps requires a lot of technical excellence, and it is a long way up.

Drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sefford) or by [email](mailto:sefford@gmail.com), I'll be more than happy to chat!
